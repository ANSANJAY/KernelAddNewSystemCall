## The Power of System Calls :zap:

System calls form the bridge between the user-space and kernel-space, enabling user programs to request services from the kernel. Whether it's accessing hardware, managing resources, or interacting with the file system, system calls are indispensable. Here, we explore the art of adding a custom system call tailored to specific needs.
